# LiveProjects

## Introduction

For the last 4 weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full functioning website in both MVC/MVVM Web Application in C# and Python using django. Working on a pre exsiting codebase was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. I worked on several back end and front end stories that I am very proud of. Because much of the first site had already been built, there were also a good deal of front end stories and UX improvements that needed to be completed, all of varying degrees of difficulty. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the four week sprint I also had the opportunity to work on some other project management and team programming skills that I'm confident I will use again and again on future projects.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets.
